<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><H4>Everybody knows Japan's Corporate Bodies. Sony, Honda, Yamaha, Nintendo, Canon, Mitsubishi and a score of other vast "legal persons" are now household names in the !st, 2nd and 3rd Worlds. (In contrast, one notorious 1995 survey asked Americans to list 3 famous Japanese: hands-down winners - Bruce Lee, Godzilla and Yoko Ono.) Obviously, outsiders know few of Japan's human inhabitants, let alone what they think, dream or feel. Nancho thus takes great pleasure in introducing a few of Kyoto's (thousands of)  remarkable individuals and their eloquent hopes and fears for this troubled land.</H4></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

There is so much pressure that needs an outlet that Korean people are often used as scapegoats. Last year, a politician announced that some North Korean organization was dangerous. The next day, Korean students were attacked in Kyoto; their  dresses were cut and they were kicked and insulted. There were ten incidents a day, all over Japan. A Korean grade school student was interviewed and said "An old Japanese woman asked me why I am here." This tiny girl!"</STRONG></CENTER><P>

They have probably been shaped by the patterns of discrimination and the corrective movement over the past thirty years. They have a sense of disgrace as children of the <EM>eta</EM>. Everyone thinks discrimination
comes only from the outside world, and that is the source of their pain. But it is actually coming from inside themselves, too."</STRONG></CENTER><P>

<LI><DT><H3><A HREF="nonaka.html">Craft Visionary, Nonaka Akira</A></H3><dd><CENTER><STRONG>"Japan envied western industrial power so we copied their most industrial education systems. Serving the individual, serving the nation's history or culture, even serving Japan's long-term best interests were never even an educational question. Everything, everybody was to serve the industrial system. There had been indigenous educational traditions for craftspeople that grew up during Edo, and the new system set out to systematically destroy them. The fewer self-employed craftsmen there were, the more jobless laborers would be available for industry."</STRONG></CENTER><P>


<LI><DT><H3><A HREF="ono.html">Human Rights Pioneer, Ono Nobuyuki</A></H3><dd><CENTER><STRONG>"The whole idea of human rights begins with self-respect and a sense of what is valuable in one's life. People are losing the habit or capacity for sympathy, compassion. It is bound up with your sensitivity to your environment generally. When your environment is damaged, it can scar you too. Many people cope with that pain by turning themselves off, by learning to feel less. It is not just an aesthetic problem. It has a lot of important social and political effects."</STRONG></CENTER><P>

     they're the real ruling class. And they guarantee their position at the top by making
     sure there is a permanent crowd down at the bottom. Hell, they want outlaws,
     criminals, desperate people out there on the streets. It frightens the wits out of the
     middle class and keeps them quiet.  And then when the government says they need
     more money for security, more police, more sacrifice of your rights and more
     interference in your life, nobody says a word."</STRONG></CENTER><P>

     like some of our discriminated minorities, competing with each other; and partly to just get better ideas
     on how to defend ourselves, how to survive."</STRONG></CENTER><P>
